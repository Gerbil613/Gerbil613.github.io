        <h1>Ezekiel and John's Revelation</h1>
        <span class="date">January 4, 2026</span>
        
        <p>The book of Ezekiel, the third of the major prophets of the Hebrew Bible, is known for his vivid description of visions of the heavenly throne and the beings that surround it. The Apocalypse of St. John, known more commonly as the Book of Revelation, appears to pick up Ezekiel's style and adapt it to a 1st-century Christian eschatology.</p>

        <p>Revelation is also known for its unusual number of <em>solecisms</em>: Greek that is ungrammatical and unnatural, which points to an absence of native proficiency on the part of the author. There is a theory that the solecisms in Revelation functioned in part to emulate the grammatical quirks of Ezekiel, which are themselves difficult to parse at times.</p>

        <h2>Quirks in Ezekiel</h2>

        <p>As a first example, the most famous line from Ezekiel in Jewish liturgy comes from chapter 3, which forms an integral part of the <em>Kedusha</em> thrice-holy incantation:</p>

        <blockquote class="quote-right">
                   וַתִּשָּׂאֵ֣נִי ר֔וּחַ וָאֶשְׁמַ֣ע אַחֲרַ֔י ק֖וֹל רַ֣עַשׁ גָּד֑וֹל <b>בָּר֥וּךְ כְּבוֹד־יְקוָ֖ק מִמְּקוֹמֽוֹ</b>׃

        <footer>Ezekiel 3:12</footer>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote class="quote">
                    And a wind picked me up and I heard behind me a the voice of a great sound: <b>Blessed is the glory of the LORD from His place</b>.
<footer>Ezekiel 3:12 (translation by me)</footer>
</blockquote>

        <p>The language here is arguably a bit off. Presumably the idea is the sound being described is itself speaking, but usually when words are spoken in Ezekiel, the speaker (e.g. God or an angel) is more clearly identified. Instead, critical scholars have opted to understand this central verse as being corrupted. It is argued that the text originally read </p>

            <blockquote class="quote-right">
ותשאני רוח ואשמע אחרי קול רעש גדול ברום כבוד יקוק ממקומו
        <footer>Restored Ezekiel 3:12</footer>
        </blockquote>

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    And a wind picked me up and I heard behind me a the voice of a great sound <em>when the glory of the LORD rose from His place.</em>
<footer>Restored Ezekiel 3:12 (translation by me)</footer>
</blockquote>

        <p>Only one letter has been switched. There are two substantial pieces of evidence to back up the otherwise dubious claim that this is the original intent. Firstly, the <em>exact</em> same phraseology already appears elsewhere in Ezekiel! Note</p>

                    <blockquote class="quote-right">
                        וַיָּ֤רׇם כְּבוֹד־יְקוָק מֵעַ֣ל הַכְּר֔וּב עַ֖ל מִפְתַּ֣ן הַבָּ֑יִת וַיִּמָּלֵ֤א הַבַּ֙יִת֙ אֶת־הֶ֣עָנָ֔ן וְהֶֽחָצֵר֙ מָֽלְאָ֔ה אֶת־נֹ֖גַהּ כְּב֥וֹד יְקוָֽק
        <footer>Ezekiel 10:4</footer>
        </blockquote>

                <blockquote class="quote">
                    And the glory of the LORD rose over the cherub on the threshold of the temple, and the temple was filled with the cloud and the courtyard with the radiant light of the glory of the LORD</em>
<footer>Ezekiel 10:4 (translation by me)</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>The Hebrew verb for "rose" and term for "glory of the LORD" is identical here. The second convincing piece of evidence is that the Paleo-Hebrew letters that were supposedly switched look very similar.</p>

</figure>

<p>While it is not certain that this emendation is correct due to lack of manuscript evidence, we can be reasonably confident in it as a hypothesis.</p>

<p>Now, I'll review some interesting grammatical quirks in Ezekiel that are more relevant to our following discussion and connection to revelation, pulled from Block (1988)<sup id="ref-1"><a href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup>. He lists a whole bunch of grammatical oddities in Ezekiel's vision in chapter 1, categorizing them by confusions of number, gender, etc. but it'll suffice for us to see one example of these oddities:</p>

                <blockquote class="quote-right">
                    וּדְמ֣וּת פְּנֵיהֶם֮ פְּנֵ֣י אָדָם֒ וּפְנֵ֨י אַרְיֵ֤ה אֶל־הַיָּמִין֙ לְאַרְבַּעְתָּ֔ם וּפְנֵי־שׁ֥וֹר מֵהַשְּׂמֹ֖אול לְאַרְבַּעְתָּ֑ן וּפְנֵי־נֶ֖שֶׁר לְאַרְבַּעְתָּֽן׃
        <footer>Ezekiel 1:10</footer>
        </blockquote>

                        <blockquote class="quote">
                    And the image of their face [was] the face of a man, and the face of a lion to the right of the four of them, and the face of a bull to the left of the four of them, and the face of an eagle to the four of them.
<footer>Ezekiel 1:10 (translation by me)</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>The difficulty here is that the gender of the four of "them" switches from masculine to feminine just within this verse. I wouldn't necessarily argue that this actually constitutes a grammatical error by Ezekiel himself. It is possible that there is some esoteric, poetic intention behind the obfuscating use of gender here, such as to contrast one side of the Being from the other by assigning them different genders.</p>

<p>The point here, though, is that John of Patmos, when looking to Ezekiel for inspiration for his work, he was not able to fully account for all the grammatical features he observed. This may account for the poor Greek he employs, which we shall now discuss.</p>

<h2>Solecisms in Revelation</h2>

<p>John writes</p>

<blockquote class="quote">
                    ὁ νικῶν, ποιήσω αὐτὸν στύλον ἐν τῷ ναῷ τοῦ θεοῦ μου, καὶ ἔξω οὐ μὴ ἐξέλθῃ ἔτι, καὶ γράψω ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν τὸ ὄνομα τοῦ θεοῦ μου καὶ τὸ ὄνομα τῆς πόλεως τοῦ θεοῦ μου, τῆς καινῆς Ἱερουσαλήμ, ἡ καταβαίνουσα ἐκ τοῦ οὐρανοῦ ἀπὸ τοῦ θεοῦ μου, καὶ τὸ ὄνομά μου τὸ καινόν.
<footer>Revelation 3:12</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote class="quote">
                    He who wins, I shall make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall never go out of it, and I shall inscribe upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the New Jerusalem, which comes down out of the heavens from my God, and my new name.
<footer>Revelation 3:12 (translation by me)</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>The difficulty lies in the participial phrase <em>ἡ καταβαίνουσα</em>. It refers to the New Jerusalem, τῆς καινῆς Ἱερουσαλήμ, which is clearly in the genitive case. Classical Greek rules would dictate that the participle should be genitive too, but it's not; it's nominative. This grammatical slip-up, and the many others like it (which I don't have the energy to list out in this post, see Best), have been the subject of intense debate by scholars. According to Best (2021)<sup id="ref-2"><a href="#fn-2">[2]</a></sup>, four main theories exist: </p>

<ol>
    <li>John thought in Hebrew or Aramaic when writing in Greek</li>
    <li>John was influenced by the irregular Greek of the Septuagint</li>
    <li>John translated from Hebrew source text</li>
    <li>John translated from Aramaic source text</li>
</ol>

<p>However, Block notes that these grammatical irregularities in Revelation may be explained as being part of the overall genre, as we saw in Ezekiel. He even suggests that the traumatic nature of the vision may have influenced Ezekiel to write the way he did, reflecting the "emotional impact." In any case, I think it's interesting and notable that both works contain grammatical difficulties when one so very clearly influenced the other.</p>
