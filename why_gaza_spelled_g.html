        <h1>Why does Gaza start with a <em>g</em>?</h1>
        <span class="date">December 9, 2025</span>
        
        <p>If you’ve ever heard Gaza pronounced natively in Arabic, you might have noticed that the first sound, rather than actually being a g, is more of a trilled, guttural sound—a bit like a French <em>r</em>. Technically, it’s a velar fricative. A<em>g</em>is also a velar sound.</p>

        <p>Now, the fact that languages different from English might contain sounds not found in English is no surprise to anyone. However, when you start to dig for the earliest historical occurrences of the term Gaza, you find yourself in Hebrew, not Arabic! Specifically, Gaza is mentioned several times in the Hebrew Bible as a place name (for instance, v. 1 Kings 5:4).</p>

        <p>Here’s the kicker: in the Hebrew, Gaza is not spelt with a<em>g</em>sound in the beginning, nor any sort of trilled sound at all! It’s spelt with an ‘ayin (ע), which traditionally makes an even more guttural (pharyngeal) sound. See here to listen to how it’s traditionally pronounced.</p>

        <p>So what gives? Why is the earliest occurrence of the term spelt with a letter that seems to make a different sound? The answer is that the letter ‘ayin didn't always make that sound, and this variation in its pronunciation is a stepping stone into a wider world of the development of the phonologies of Semitic languages.</p>

        <p>How can we tell that this letter had an alternative pronunciation among Hebrew speakers at some point in time? A clue lies in the Septuagint. This is a 2nd century BC translation of the Hebrew Bible into Koine Greek, produced by Jewish scribes in Alexandria. There, we find the term written Γαζα, with a gamma. This is highly indicative of the fact that Hebrew speakers were pronouncing the ‘ayin with the fricative<em>g</em>(velar) sound, rather than just the traditional pharyngeal.</p>

        <p>However, for other terms, the Septuagint transliterates the ‘ayin silently, leaving only the vowel after it standing. These cases reflect that the ‘ayin in those words was pronounced traditionally, as the pharyngeal sound is farther in the throat from where the<em>g</em>is articulated and closer to where a glottal stop, which in English is basically a null sound<sup id="ref-1"><a href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup>, is articulated. For example, for the Hebrew name עזריה (Jacob) (1 Kings 4:2), we find Ἀζαριας, with no gamma in sight. Most interestingly, the Septuagint is wholly consistent in whether a given name uses one pronunciation of the ayin versus the other.</p>

        <p>Thus, it is tempting to conclude that there were originally two, mutually exclusive sounds that were both transcribed by the Hebrew letter ‘ayin. Indeed, if we return to Arabic, there are two ayin sounds: ع for the pharyngeal, غ for the velar, and they have these two pronunciations. It seems, then, that Arabic has preserved the distinction, while Hebrew merged them sometime after the translation of the Septuagint.</p>

        <p>But that’s not all! It turns out that we observe the exact same phenomenon with the Hebrew letter ḥeth, ח. The name Rachel (רחל) is rendered in the Septuagint as Rachēl (Ραχηλ), with a chi, but the name Hanania (חנינה) is rendered Ananias (Ἀνανιας), with no trace of the ḥeth. Peering into Arabic once again, we see two different ḥeth’s: a pharyngeal ح and a velar خ.</p>

        <p>We can make the jump between Hebrew and Arabic here iron-clad by considering cognates between the two languages. The Hebrew word for brother is aḥ (אח), and in Arabic, ach (أخ, a velar ḥeth). Luckily, this word appears as an element in the name Aḥitophel (2 Kings 16:20, “my brother is folly”), which the Septuagint indeed renders with a chi.</p>

        <p>The final piece of comparative evidence that I’ll give here is in Akkadian, which is almost a Semitic language, spoken out east in Mesopotamia a thousand years before Hebrew. There, we find the word for brother as aḫum, where it can be shown that a phonetic value is being used to represent the ḥeth. In contrast, the Akkadian word for take is lequm, where it can be shown that the phonetic value ḫ is no longer present at the end of the root. The corresponding Hebrew word is laqaḥ (לקח), ending in a heth<sup id="ref-2"><a href="#fn-2">[2]</a></sup>.</p>

            The situation is a bit more complicated here since select Akkadian words are not spelt phonetically, but with logograms. The word for brother is one such word. However, we roughly know how to reconstruct the phonetic Akkadian pronunciation because grammar students would practice writing logograms phonetically.
