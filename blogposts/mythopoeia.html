        <h1>On arboreal trees and tellurian earth</h1>
        <span class="date">December 10, 2025</span>
        
        <p>I'll take this post to briefly highlight some rather disorganized philological and literary musings on Tolkien's <em><a href="https://www.tolkien.ro/text/JRR%20Tolkien%20-%20Mythopoeia.pdf" target="_blank" class="cyan-link">Mythopoeia</a></em>.</p>
            
        <p>Overall, I found the poem to be littered with biblical allusions, particularly from Genesis. This feature comports well with the poem's force overall, as the work deals heavily with themes of creation. Indeed, the very title of the poem means myth-making in Greek<sup id="ref-1"><a href="#fn-1">[1]</a></sup>. The speaker and addressee are named Story-lover and story-hater, or something to that effect. This suggests that one intention of the work is to compel the reader to appreciate art and story making, especially in the face of the increasing rigidity of modernization and cold, scientific progress&mdash;the "Iron Crown," as Tolkien puts it. </p>

        <p>
            Later, he employs a rather overt allusion, stating
        </p>
        <blockquote>
        Blessed are the men of Noah's race that build<br>
their little arks, though frail and poorly filled,<br>
and steer through winds contrary towards a wraith,<br>
a rumour of a harbour guessed by faith<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
        Here, he seems to have slightly inverted the original Noah story. While in the biblical narrative Noah is the unique individual chosen to build an ark and be saved, Tolkien envisions a whole race of people building up their arks together. Perhaps he intends to express optimism about human nature, imagining that many people can be called as righteous ones to build an ark. Perhaps it is a prediction for the future.</p><p>

        In any case, Tolkien seemlessly weaves this allusion to the Hebrew Bible into an allusion from the New Testament. Indeed, the text of the poem at this point simulates the Beatitudes given by Christ at the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5. This lends creedence to the idea that Tolkien aims to express optimism. One of the distinguishing features of the New Testament is its universality and hope for salvation through grace alone, in contrast to the Hebrew Bible's tribality and salvation through rigorous obedience to God's commandments.</p>

        <p>
            Tolkien writes earlier,
        </p>

        <blockquote>
...There is no firmament,<br>
only a void, unless a jewelled tent
</blockquote>

        <p>The use of the two terms firmament and void in such proximity is undoubtably a reference to the language of the King James Version, an edition with which we would expect Tolkien to be highly familiar. In the Genesis story, the firmament is formed to separate the void. Tolkien's assertion that the "jeweled tent" is necessary for the existence of anything nontrivial indicates his belief in the necessity for human creation in the world, if we take the jeweled tent as a symbol for artistic activity.</p>

        <p>Finally, I'll close out with a clever use of Latinate wordplay.</p>

                <blockquote>
God made the petreous rocks, the arboreal trees,<br>
tellurian earth, and stellar stars, and these<br>
homuncular men, who walk upon the ground<br>
with nerves that tingle touched by light and sound.<br>
</blockquote>
<p>
        Petreous comes from the Greek root for rocks (<em>πετρα</em>), arboreal from the Latin word for tree (<em>arbor</em>), tellurian from a Latin word for earth (<em>tellus</em>), stellar from the Latin word for star (<em>stella</em>), and homuncular from the diminutive of the Latin word for man (<em>homo</em>). Tolkien clearly knew his stuff.</p>

            Greek μυθος in Homer has an additional (and arguably in some cases more common) sense of "word," rather than "story." Although Tolkien was surely well-versed in Greek, he likely intended the latter sense here.
