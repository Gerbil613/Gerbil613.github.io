        <h1>Scribal errors in the Hebrew Bible</h1>
        <span class="date">December 10, 2025</span>
        <h2>Prelude</h2>
        <p>
            I'll start off this post on scribal errors in the Hebrew Bible by giving an example of something that is <em>not</em>, in fact, a scribal error in the Hebrew Bible.
        </p>

        <p>
            Let's look at Isaiah 40:7-8 in the Great Isaiah Scroll in Qumran, one of the best-preserved Dead Sea Scrolls.
        </p>

        <figure>

        <figcaption>Isaiah 40:7-8 as found in the Great Isaiah Scroll.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>The passage itself reads (not yet including margin notes),</p>

        <blockquote class="quote-right">
                    קול אומר קרא ואומרת מה אקרא כל הבשר חציר וכל חסדיו כציץ  <br>
                    השדה יבש חציר נבל ציץ <b>!!!</b> ודבר אלהינו יקום לעולם
                    <br>על הר גבה  עלי לכי מבשרת ציון הרימי בכוח קולך מבשרת ירושלים
                </blockquote>

        <p>You then notice that extra words have been written in the margins. They say</p>

                <blockquote class="quote-right">
                    כי רוח .... נשבה בו אכן חציר העם
                </blockquote>
            
            
            <p>Why? Well, consider the Masoretic text:</p>

                <blockquote class="quote-right">
                    יָבֵ֤שׁ חָצִיר֙ נָ֣בֵֽל־צִ֔יץ כִּ֛י ר֥וּחַ יְהֹוָ֖ה נָ֣שְׁבָה בּ֑וֹ אָכֵ֥ן חָצִ֖יר הָעָֽם׃  <br>

יָבֵ֥שׁ חָצִ֖יר נָ֣בֵֽל צִ֑יץ וּדְבַר־אֱלֹהֵ֖ינוּ יָק֥וּם לְעוֹלָֽם׃ {ס}

<footer>Isaiah 40:7-8</footer>
</blockquote>

        <p>
            It becomes clear what happened. The two verses begin with the same sequence of four words. Thus, when an unscrupulous scribe was copying this text, their eyes jumped to the second occurrence, inadvertently skipping the first. This error is known as <em>parablepsis</em>. Later, someone reviewed the scribe's work and caught the mistake, writing the missing content in on top. The exclamation points I supplied note where more text is present in the Masoretic text, but is missing here. The note written in the margin <em>is</em> that text.
        </p>

        <p>
            The story doesn't end there. If we look at these verses in the Septuagint, this exact error is reproduced.
        </p>

        <blockquote>
            ἐξηράνθη ὁ χόρτος, καὶ τὸ ἄνθος ἐξέπεσε, <br> τὸ δὲ ρῆμα τοῦ Θεοῦ ἡμῶν μένει εἰς τὸν αἰῶνα.
<footer>Isaiah 40:7-8 in the Septuagint</footer>
</blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            The grass hath dried up, and the flower hath fallen, but the speech of our God stayeth unto the ages.
<footer>Isaiah 40:7-8 in the Septuagint (translation supplied by me)</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>
    Indeed, the Septuagint entirely lacks what is Isaiah 40:7 in the Masoretic text. Only the equivalent of Isaiah 40:8 is present, divided into two verses. Evidently, some scribe in the chain of transmission of the Septuagint fell victim to the very same error that was narrowly avoided in the Dead Sea Scrolls. Observations like these show us the fallible human element present in textual transmission, including in sacred texts.
</p>

<h2>Parablepsis in the Hebrew Bible</h2>

<p>There are several strong candidates for instances of parablepsis in the Hebrew Bible, not just the Greek translation. For instance, we see in the Masoretic text</p>

<blockquote class="quote-right">
                    וְזֹ֛את תִּהְיֶ֥ה טֻמְאָת֖וֹ בְּזוֹב֑וֹ רָ֣ר בְּשָׂר֞וֹ אֶת־זוֹב֗וֹ אֽוֹ־הֶחְתִּ֤ים בְּשָׂרוֹ֙ מִזּוֹב֔וֹ טֻמְאָת֖וֹ הִֽוא
<footer>Leviticus 15:3</footer>
</blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            And this shall be his uncleanliness in his discharge: [whether] his organ flow with discharge or his organ be blocked of discharge, it is his uncleanliness:
<footer>Leviticus 15:3 (translation supplied by me)</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>However, the equivalent verse in the Septuagint has extra content appended:</p>

<blockquote>
καὶ οὗτος ὁ νόμος τῆς ἀκαθαρσίας αὐτοῦ· ρέων γόνον ἐκ σώματος αὐτοῦ, ἐκ τῆς ρύσεως, ἧς συνέστηκε τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ διὰ τῆς ρύσεως, αὕτη ἡ ἀκαθαρσία αὐτοῦ <b>ἐν αὐτῷ· πᾶσαι αἱ ἡμέραι ρύσεως σώματος αὐτοῦ, ᾗ συνέστηκε τὸ σῶμα αὐτοῦ διά τῆς ρύσεως, ἀκαθαρσία αὐτοῦ ἐστι</b>
<footer>Leviticus 15:3 in the Septuagint</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
And this is the law of his uncleanliness: should his organ be flowing discharge out of his organ, which his organ undergoes during his discharge, this is his uncleanliness <b>in him, for all the days of the discharge of his organ, during which his organ is afflicted with discharge, his uncleanliness is:</b>
<footer>Leviticus 15:3 in the Septuagint (translation supplied by me)</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>The Samaritan Pentateuch (SP) also has extra content here:</p>

<blockquote class="quote-right">
זאת תהיה טמאתו בזובו רר בשרו את זובו או <b>חתום בשרו בזובו טמא היא כל ימי זב בשרו</b> או החתים בשרו מזובו טמאתו היא
<footer>Leviticus 15:3 in the Samaritan Pentateuch</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Here is how it appears in Samaritan script for fun:</p>

<figure>
<img src="/images/samaritan_leviticus.png" alt="Image of Text in Leviticus of Samaritan Pentateuch" class="post-img">
<figcaption>Image of text in Leviticus of Samaritan Pentateuch.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>While the addition in the SP seems to be slightly different than the Septuagint, the texts agree the Masoretic text is lacking content. The nail in the coffin comes from the Dead Sea Scrolls themselves:</p>

<figure>
<img src="/images/dss_lev_15_3.png" alt="Image of text in scroll 11Q1." class="post-img">
<figcaption>Image of text in <a href="https://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/explore-the-archive/image/B-480102" target="_blank" class="cyan-link">scroll</a> 11Q1.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
If you can't read Paleo-Hebrew, you'll have to take my word for it, but the phrase <em>כל ימי</em> (each day) is clearly present on the third line from the bottom. This line is nowhere to be found in Leviticus 15 in the Masoretic text, but it is found in the SP as well as the Septuagint (<em>πασαι αἱ ἡμεραι</em>, "all the days"). The surrounding text of the fragment, however, make it clear that it is meant to be Leviticus 15. <em>ישכב עליו</em> (Leviticus 15:4) is legible on the second line from the bottom, <em>טמאתו בזב[ו?]</em> (Leviticus 15:3) on the fourth line from the bottom, and <em>ואמרתם אלהם</em> (Leviticus 15:2) on the fifth line from the bottom.
</p>

<p>Rabbi Jacob Milgrom writes in the <em>Yale Anchor Bible Commentary</em></p>

<blockquote>
 ...the occurrence of bw shows that as between Sam. and LXX, 11Q Lev. agrees with LXX … and not with Sam.” (Freedman 1974: 529). All three of the above-cited texts clearly illustrate that the additions to the MT could have fallen out by homoioteleuton. Thus it is reasonable to assume that the addition is required (Freedman 1974; Tov 1978–79). It is, however, difficult to choose among the texts. Each is plausible: each stresses the fact that the impurity lasts as long as the discharge.<footer>Jacob Milgrom on Leviticus 15, <em>Yale Anchor Bible Commentary</em></footer>
</blockquote>

<p>The Septuagint addition ends with roughly the same sequence that precedes it, <em>αὕτη ἡ ἀκαθαρσία αὐτοῦ</em>, "this is his uncleanliness". We can guess that the original Hebrew Vorlage from which the Septuagint was translated had the missing content, and it was elided in scribal transmission later due to homoioteleuton in the Hebrew.</p>

        <h2><em>Puncta extraordinaria</em></h2>

        <p>Another point we'll touch on are the <em>puncta extraordinaria</em> (pun intended), which are dots placed above letters in the Masoretic tradition. They are still present in all modern Torah scrolls written for Jewish liturgical use.</p>

        <p>Mefarshim provide a variety of explanation and theories as to their origin, but here we hone in on their use in ancient manuscripts. Evidently, they were used to mark mistaken letters and designate them for future deletion, especially in the case of the tetragrammaton, since erasing it was (and still is) considered a sin.</p>

        <p>A clear example of the <em>puncta extraordinaria</em> is, once again, in the Great Isaiah Scroll.</p>

        <figure>
<img src="/images/puncta_extraordinaria_isaiah.png" alt="Image of text in Great Isaiah Scroll." class="post-img">
<figcaption>Puncta extraordinaria in the Great Isaiah Scroll 36:7.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>If one looks in the corresponding verse in the Masoretic text, בירושלים is absent, showing some scribe successfully removed the word at some point in transmission.</p>

<p>One of the cases of <em>puncta extraordinaria</em> in the Masoretic text is found in Numbers 21:30. The Hebrew reads </p>

<blockquote class="quote-right">
                    וַנִּירָ֛ם אָבַ֥ד חֶשְׁבּ֖וֹן עַד־דִּיבֹ֑ן וַנַּשִּׁ֣ים עַד־נֹ֔פַח אֲשֶׁ֖<b>רׄ</b> עַד־מֵֽידְבָֽא׃

<footer>Numbers 21:30</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>This verse in the Septuagint is translated as if the <em>resh</em> is not there, meaning <em>אש</em> "fire":
</p>

<blockquote class="quote">
                    καὶ τὸ σπέρμα αὐτῶν ἀπολεῖται, ᾿Εσεβὼν ἕως Δαιβών, καὶ αἱ γυναῖκες ἔτι προσεξέκαυσαν <b>πῦρ</b> ἐπὶ Μωάβ.
<footer>Numbers 21:30 in Septuagint</footer>
</blockquote>

<p>Note <em>pyr</em> for fire. All in all, it's not 100% clear whether the puncta extraordinaria are always originally markers of error, or if they only served this purpose in some cases, while in others they were meant more for emphasis. In any case, there's clearly some error marking functionality they have, and they have been preserved into our text today. </p>
