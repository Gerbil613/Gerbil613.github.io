        <h1>Debuccalization</h1>

        <p>It doesn't feel like the way language changes over time should be an intelligible process. You'd think that people just sort of start speaking differently than their parents arbitrarily, and those effects accrete with time. Surprisingly, however, there are many sound changes that have occurred independently and with regularity across the globe and across time. One such sound change is <em>debuccalization</em>.</p>

        <p>
            Essentially, it involves a sound moving its place of articulation back into the glottis. I'll give interesting examples of it across various languages.
        </p>

        <p>
            First, let's look at Spanish. We notice a lot of words that begin with <em>h</em>: <em>hacienda</em> (hacienda), <em>hierro</em> (iron), <em>hijo</em> (son), <em>hablar</em> (speak), <em>hongo</em> (fungus). What are the Latin words from which these words derive? <em>facienda</em>, <em>ferrum</em>, <em>filius</em>, <em>fabulare</em>, <em>fungus</em>. Clearly something statistically significant is going on here. In short, Spanish changed <em>f</em> to <em>h</em> in the beginning of words. <h>h</h> is articulated in the glottis, as it's a voiceless glottal fricative.
        </p>

        <p>
            Now, it turns out that we can even compare English to Latin and detect debuccalization, too! Consider: <em>hound</em>, <em>hundred</em>, <em>head</em>, <em>heart</em>, <em>horse</em>. Now in Latin: <em>canis</em> (dog), <em>centum</em> (hundred), <em>caput</em> (head), <em>cor</em> (heart), <em>currus</em> (chariot). This time, the initial /k/ debuccalized&mdash;eerily similar to the Spanish example.
        </p>

        <p>
            Some of you may be wondering, "wait a second, why are we comparing English to Latin? English is not a Romance language!" True, but it is a universal scholarly consensus that English and Latin stem from a very old (~7000 years) common ancestor called Proto-Indo-European, which sources a great number of other world languages as well, ranging from Hindi to Russian to Persian to Gaelic to Norwegian. This specific debuccalization is thought to have occurred in Proto-Germanic, so all equivalent Germanic language terms for the examples we provided should start with an <em>h</em>, too.
        </p>

        <p>
            But debuccalization isn't limited to Indo-European languages: it is even seen in Semitic languages. In Hebrew, verbs of the classes הפעיל ,התפעל and הופעל all begin with /h/ in their past tense form. But in Akkadian, the equivalent forms begin with /ʃ/ ("sh" as in "shallot", universally romanized as <em>š</em>). For instance, Akkadian 𒋗𒍮𒌝 (šūṣum) is cognate with Hebrew הוציא (hoṣi), meaning to "take out, cause to go out."
        </p>
            
        <p>Indeed, even the Akkadian words for "he" and "she" are not הוא (/hu/) and היא (/hi/) like in Hebrew or هو /huwa/ and هي /hiya/ like Arabic, but 𒋗𒌑 (/ʃuː/, <em>shu</em>) and 𒅆𒄿 (/ʃiː/, <em>shi</em>). We see that West Semitic languages like Hebrew and Arabic (which date to much later than Akkadian) debuccalized the original initial /ʃ/, which Akkadian preserves.
